Calendar Generator
=================================================

> This tool will generate calendar borders.

Usage
-------------------------------------------------
On execution, it will launch a command prompt.
Two inputs are needed: The year to generate the
border for, and the directory to which the
generated files are saved to. Press Enter to use
the default values shown in the square brackets.

The script will then generate twelve PNG files,
one for each month. Each has a white border, the
month of the respective month depicted, the
number of days and its weekdays. Sundays and
Holidays are shown in bold.

The script uses a settings file which can be
changed, the `settings.ini` file.
